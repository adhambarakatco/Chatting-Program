# Chatting-Program
TCP Client-Server Chat Application
This repository contains a Java-based TCP client-server application developed as part of a Computer Networks assignment (CNET101). The project demonstrates basic socket programming, enabling two-way communication between a client and a server over a network.

Features:

Milestone 1: Implemented a client-server model where the server listens for incoming client connections. The client sends a message that is converted to uppercase by the server.
Milestone 2: Extended the application to support bi-directional chatting between the client and server, usable across different devices within a network.
Milestone 3: Used Wireshark to trace and analyze TCP packets exchanged during communication.
The project uses Java sockets to create a simple chat application, showcasing fundamental client-server communication concepts and TCP packet analysis using Wireshark.
